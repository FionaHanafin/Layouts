# Layouts
Develop an app to create a login screen using the linear layout using nested layouts
and create the same layout for the login screen using relative layout. Can create
multiple activities to navigate from one screen to another within the same
application to demonstrate the working of the 3 layouts and also navigating from
one activity to another.
The app should consist of 3 layout xml files, 3 activities:
XML:
1. UI for the login screen using linear layout
2. UI for the login screen using relative layout.
3. UI for the dial pad using table layout
Activities:
1. First activity to show the linear layout page and a button to navigate to the
login screen using relative layout.
2. Second activity to show the login screen using relative layout and a button to
navigate the dial pad activity
3. Third activity to the UI for dial pad and display the number in the edit text
control
